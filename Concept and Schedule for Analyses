Concept and Schedule for Analyses

1. Introduction

The aim is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the bank's customer data to identify potential business opportunities and client segments. The analysis will encompass data quality assessment, exploratory data analysis, correlation studies, and hypothesis generation for product sales/use.

2. Data Assessment and Quality Check, October 14-20, 2023

2.1 Initial Data Exploration: A quick overview of the dataset to understand its structure, features, and potential missing or inconsistent values.
2.2 Data Cleaning: Identify and handle missing values, duplicate records, and outliers.
2.3 Data Transformation: Convert categorical data into numerical format if required, and normalize or standardize the dataset as needed.



3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) October 21-27, 2023

3.1 Univariate Analysis: Understand the distribution of individual attributes using histograms, boxplots, etc.
3.2 Bivariate Analysis: Discover relationships between two variables using scatter plots, correlation matrices, etc.
3.3 Temporal Analysis: Analyze changes in data attributes over time using line charts, time series decomposition, etc.



4. Correlation and Relationship Analysis October 28 - November 3, 2023

4.1 Correlation Matrix: Identify the relationships between numerical variables.
4.2 Pair Plot: Visualize relationships between multiple variables.
4.3 Chi-Squared Test: Check relationships between categorical variables.



5. Hypothesis Generation for Product Sales/Use November 4-10, 2023

5.1 Client Segmentation: Use clustering algorithms (like K-means) to group clients into different segments based on their data attributes.
5.2 Hypothesis Testing: Conduct tests (e.g., t-test, ANOVA) to validate hypotheses related to product sales and use.



6. Client Analytical Record November 11-17, 2023

6.1 Consolidation: Aggregate all relevant data for each client into a single record.
6.2 Visualization: Create a dashboard or visual representation for each client's analytical record.



7. Final Report and Documentation

7.1 Compile results into a comprehensive report.
7.2 Structure and document analyses in an Rmd notebook for future use within the bank.
7.3 Presentation: Prepare visualizations and insights for easy comprehension by the client.

Delivery of Analysis Concept with Hypotheses, Work Packages, and Time Schedule: October 13, 2023
Delivery of Final Report Rmd Notebook: January 12, 2024
